            <h1><strong>Welcome To Our Study Notes and Projects</strong></h1>
            <h3>A collaborative effort by Marius Landsverk and Dag Andreas Folvell</h3>
            <h2>About our website</h2>
            <p>This website is a showcase of our study notes, which we have created and will continue to create 
                during the course of our studies and careers.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Our notes are uploaded to a shared GitHub repository.</li>
                <li>The website makes calls to the GitHub API to fetch the latest notes.</li>
                <li>These notes are then displayed on the site, ensuring up-to-date content.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>With our website, we've implemented a fun system that automatically updates whenever we add new notes 
                to our dedicated GitHub folder. This ensures that our latest notes are readily available and always 
                up-to-date for easy access. Our primary aim in creating this website was to delve into the fundamentals 
                of HTML, CSS, JS and SQL, learning how to utilize these technologies to build an interactive platform showcasing
                our work. We're excited to share our projects and make them accessible to anyone interested in what we do.</p>
